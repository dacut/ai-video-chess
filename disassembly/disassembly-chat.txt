> I've created a comprehensive annotated version of the Atari Video Chess ROM dump, broken into 7 parts for readability. Here's what I've documented:

## Key Features Identified:

System Architecture:
• 6507 processor code starting at $F000
• Proper initialization with stack setup and RAM clearing
• TIA (Television Interface Adapter) register usage for display

Chess Game Implementation:
• Complete chess rules including special moves (castling, en passant)
• AI opponent with multiple difficulty levels
• Move validation and legal move checking
• Board state management and piece tracking

Display System:
• Scanline-based graphics generation
• Chess piece sprites and board rendering
• Display buffer management
• Board flipping for player perspective

Input/Output:
• Joystick input processing for piece movement
• Console switch reading (difficulty, game select)
• Sound generation for move feedback
• Timer-based game state updates

AI Logic:
• Move evaluation and scoring
• Difficulty-based move selection
• Board position analysis
• Computer move generation

Data Structures:
• Lookup tables for piece movement patterns
• Graphics data for chess pieces
• Sound frequency tables
• Board evaluation constants

The code shows sophisticated programming techniques for the limited 4KB ROM space, including efficient memory usage, compact algorithms, and clever use of the Atari 2600's hardware capabilities to create a fully functional chess game.
